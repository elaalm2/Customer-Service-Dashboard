## üóÇÔ∏è Case Study
A rapidly growing tech support center was struggling with visibility into service quality, agent performance, and customer satisfaction. With support tickets coming from multiple channels and countries, leadership needed a consolidated reporting system to track performance and identify areas for improvement.  

## üéØ Objective  
Build an interactive dashboard that helps:
> - Monitor ticket lifecycle and SLA adherence
> - Evaluate CSAT (Customer Satisfaction) trends
> - Pinpoint sub-categories with high complaint volumes
> - Assess overall efficiency and areas needing process improvement

## Main ùêäùêèùêàùê¨
- **<ins>Service Level (%)</ins>**: (Target: > 91.5%) Percentage of calls answered within your target time (30s).
- **<ins>Answer Rate (%)</ins>**: (Target: > 95%) Percentage of calls answered vs. total calls received.
- **<ins>Hold Time (%)</ins>**: (Target: < 10%) Percentage of time callers wait on hold from total in the call after answering. 
- **<ins>First Call Resolution (FCR %)</ins>**: (Target: > 80%) Percentage of problems solved in the first call.
- **<ins>Customer Satisfaction (CSAT %)</ins>**: (Target: > 4.4) Rating of Satisfaction customers (rated 1-5 stars).
- **<ins>Average Handle Time (AHT)</ins>**: (Target: < 10:30) Average time agents spend per call without waiting time.

## Process
1) Explored and validated the call center data
2) Imported and cleaned data using Power Query with helper columns
3) Built a data model
4) Created key measures using DAX (e.g., SL, FCR, CSAT)
5) Designed an interactive Excel dashboard to visualize insights

## Important Insights
 1) **Service Level is On Target**
    - At 92.0%, we‚Äôre meeting our goal (91.5%), showing good responsiveness, but we need to keep monitoring performance on certain days.
 3) **Hold Time** 
    - Current hold rate is 10.8%, exceeding the 10% target. Process optimization may help reduce this
 3) **First Call Resolution (FCR)**
    - We achieved 92.1% FCR, which is well above the target (80%). This means most customer issues are solved on the first call a strong sign of quality service.
4) **Answer Rate Needs Improvement**
    - Current rate is 93.2%, slightly below the 95% target. This means we need to improve staffing or efficiency during busy hours.
 5) **Peak Hour is 3‚Äì4 PM**
    - The highest call volume occurs between 3:00 and 4:00 PM with over 2,450 calls. This is a key time to ensure strong agent coverage.
 6) **Sunday & Saturday weekends volume & performance**
    - Saturday and Sunday show 100% service level, mainly due to very low call volume and sufficient staffing.
 7) **Customer Inquiries & Resolution Rate**
    - The resolution rate is highest for Tech Support (80.2%) and slightly lower for Billing and Complaints (78‚Äì79%).
 8) **Some agents rated below target**
    - A few agents didn‚Äôt meet the target in several KPIs like rating, AHT, and hold %. This shows they may need more training or support to improve their performance.
